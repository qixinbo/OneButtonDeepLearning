# SimSwap: An Efficient Framework For High Fidelity Face Swapping
## Proceedings of the 28th ACM International Conference on Multimedia
**The official repository with Pytorch**

*This method can realize **arbitrary face swapping** on images and videos with **one single trained model**.*

The paper can be downloaded from [[Arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06340v1.pdf) [[ACM DOI]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3394171.3413630) 

## Weights files download
I have packaged all the weights files into one folder, just download it and paste the directories as the software guides.
